Figure 3.8: Link between biomass stability by trophic group and total species richness (median) The Figure 3.8 showed that medium trophic level part of the network had a positive stability-diversity relationship with while high trophic level had a negative one. Furthermore, we see that high trophic level compartment had a highest stability than the medium compartment. In the same vein, the latter pattern is confirmed when looking at the richness by compartment instead of the total richness (Figure 3.9). #&gt; Warning: Removed 62 rows containing non-finite values (stat_smooth). #&gt; Warning: Removed 62 rows containing non-finite values (stat_poly_eq). #&gt; Warning: Computation failed in `stat_poly_eq()`: #&gt; l&#39;argument &quot;x&quot; est manquant, avec aucune valeur par défaut #&gt; Warning: Removed 62 rows containing missing values (geom_point). Figure 3.9: Link between biomass stability and species richness by trophic group (median) One hypothesis to explain this opposite pattern might be a disequilibrium between the two compartment. We can imagine that each compartment can destabilize each other according to the part of the total biomass of total species richness that there are in each of them. The figure 3.10 showed that the biomass stability of the medium compartment decreased with the increase of biomass and species number ratio in the high compartment and we observed the reverse for the high trophic compartment. We are looking forward to fully understand why we observed this inverse relationship.
