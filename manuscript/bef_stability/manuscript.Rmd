# Abstract

# Introduction 

#### Importance of BEF assessment

Determining the shape of the relationship between species diversity and ecosystem
functioning has been a central research topic in ecology
[@may_will_1972, @hector_plant_1999, @loreau_biodiversity_2001, @hooper_effects_2005, @duffy_why_2009, @isbell_forest_quantifying_2018].
Current biodiversity losses
in all ecosystems challenge scientists to understand how ecosystems will be
affected in turn. Studies in Bioversity-Ecosystem Functioning (BEF) usually
quantify species diversity as species richness (i.e number of species) while
ecosystem functioning is quantified as total biomass, productivity (biomass
produced by unit of time) or stability which is quantified in more diverse ways
such as the variability of species abundance, the resilience to perturbation, or
resistance to perturbation [@donohue_navigating_2016].

#### Shape of BEF: total biomass

Species richness has been reported to increase productivity
[@tilman_productivity_1996, @grace_integrative_2016] through complementarity
between species in resource exploitation and selection effects
[@loreau_partioning_2001, @cardinale_species_2002, @fargione_from_2007].
Empirical assessment of the effect of species richness on total biomass showed negative
[@grace_integrative_2016] and positive relationships [@hector_plant_1999,
@tilman_biodiversity_2014]. @grace_integrative_2016 showed that the results
depend on the refinement of the mecanisms involved in the analysis.

#### Shape of BEF: stability 

The relationship between species richness and stability is even more complex
partly because of the inherent multidimensionality of stability
[@donohue_dimensionality_2013, @donohue_navigating_2016] and because of the
different metrics of stability privileged in theoretical (stability of local
equilibrium, robustness to primary extinction) and empirical work (variability
of abundance or biomass through time). Empirical studies showed consistently
that species richness decreased community variability in grasslands
[@tilman_biodiversity_2006], mesocosms [@pennekamp_biodiversity_2018] and
vertebrates [@olivier_independent_nodate, @franssen_annual_2011]. Two
mecanisms are involved into community variability, (1) species
variability and (2) the species synchrony [@loreau_species_2008, @thibaut_understanding_2013].
Positive [@tilman_biodiversity_2006], neutral
[@jiang_different_2009, @olivier_independent_nodate] and negative
[@franssen_annual_2011, @olivier_independent_nodate] relationships between
species variability and species richness have been found. On the other side,
studies consistently found that species richness decreased synchrony between
species
[@loreau_species_2008, @thibaut_understanding_2013, @bluthgen_land_2016, @olivier_independent_nodate].
Beyond species richness, species interactions, which modifies species
abondance and biomass and make species dynamics interdependant, have been
largely ignored in empirical assessment.


#### BEF: Theoretical ecology

Conversely, theoretical ecology display an extensive literature about the
effects of network structure on stability 
[@may_will_1972, @angelis_stability_1975, @stouffer_compartmentalization_2011, @thebault_stability_2010, @barbier_pyramids_2019, @shanafelt_david_w._stability_nodate].
Theoretical ecology generally uses stability definitions related to community
equilibrium and its stability to small perturbations.
Connectance (i.e. proportion of realized links in a network) can decrease
[@angelis_stability_1975, @thebault_stability_2010] or increase resilience of
trophic network depending on the functioning of networks
[@angelis_stability_1975].
The number of trophic levels, the vertical position in the trophic network as
well as the strength of their biomass regulation (i.e. top-down and bottom-up)
can determine biomass and stability at equilibrium
[@hurd_stability_1971, @shanafelt_david_w._stability_nodate, @zhao_horizontal_2019, @barbier_pyramids_2019].

A large inconsistency remains between theoretical and empirical assessments of
the relationship between community structure and ecosystem properties.
Theoretical studies have ignored temporal variability and then the relative
contribution of synchrony and species variability on community variability while
empirical studies about temporal variability and total biomass in natural
communities have ignored the contribution of network structure.

Our goal was to assess the mecanisms determining temporal variability and total
biomass in natural communities while integrating both species richness and
network structure. We combined together the effect of vertical
and horizontal diversity and thus aimed to bridge the current gap between theoretical
and empirical studies. We used an standardized monitoring of fish
communities in french streams. More than three hundreds sites were followed
more than 10 years on the 1995-2018 period. We inferred four thousands potential
interaction networks corresponding to each sampling event, based on trait
matching.

We investigated the effects of the community structure on total biomass and
community variability, which in turn determine community variability. We have
also included the effect of environmental drivers [@grace_integrative_2016]
which can directly affect community variability or indirectly via community
structure.

---

#### Protocol 

Fish communities were monitored across streams of France on the period
1995-2018 by a French governmental agency (OFB, previously AFB and ONEMA). We
kept only standardized protocols: complete and partial methods for respectively
little and big streams (detailed in Supplementary methods). In the complete
protocol, the sampling takes place over the whole width of the river and is done
by foot whereas in the partial protocol, the sampling is done over the bank only
and by boat. The sampling took place either in late spring and/or Autumn.
Heterogeneity in the sampling time may introduce variability that is not related
to ecological processes such as the presence of juveniles. In order to reduce
heterogeneity in sampling time, we select only one sampling per year if there
was two in a given year. Most of the fish sampling occurred in September
(Median: mid-August) and within station the median standard deviation of the
sampling month was inferior to one (0.7). Additionally, we removed sampling
events, in a given station, which the length of the stream sampled was outside
the median length sampled more or less 30%. The number of sampling events is
critical in order to estimate a meaningful variability of the community. We kept
only station that have been followed ten years or more (i.e 10 sampling events
or more), which sums to 403 stations.

The sampling itself was performed by electric fishing. All the stunned fish
species were identified and the individuals counted.

##### Biomass  

To characterize communities variability, abundance or biomass are generally
used. When the body size and therefore body mass vary by several orders of
magnitude, one downside of abundance is that we mix individual that have
potentially really different meaning in terms of ecosystem properties such as
biomass. We therefore estimated the body mass of fish individuals according to
their body size. During sampling, the fishes were classified in batch according
to species and size class. Depending on the batches, the body size of all
individuals were measured or only a subsample. Only the body size big fishes was
measured individually. The body size of individual fishes in subsampled batches
was inferred under normality distribution assumption (detailed in Supplementary
material). The body mass of individual fishes were then estimated with an
allometric law ($B_i = 0.01 \times l_i^3.03$, $B$ being the body mass in grams,
$l$ the body size in millimeters and $i$ the individual).

The species and community biomass were then computed for each sampling event.
As sampling effort varied across protocol type and sampling event, biomass
was reported to the surface sampled (in $m^{2}$). Community and species biomass
were then expressed in $gm^{-2}$.

Total biomass was characterized as the median total biomass over time. Community
stability was defined as the inverse of biomass variability. Variability was
computed as Coefficient of Variation (CV) of the biomass ($CV_i = \sigma_i \mu_i^{-1}$,
with $\sigma_i$ and $\mu_i$ being respectively the standard deviation and the
average of the biomass of the station $i$). Then, biomass stability was equal to
$CV^{-1} = \mu \sigma^{-1}$.

The CV of community biomass can represent very different dynamics such as
decreasing, stable or increasing. However, the concept of community variability
refered to variability around an equilibrium, which is rarely observed or
difficult to characterize in natural communities. 
We However used SAX (Symbolic Aggregate Approximation) method to caracterize
rougly biomass dynamics over time (details in Supplementary information). We
finally kept only the stations which the biomass had no trends, remaining 99
stations.
 
To characterize the mecanisms driving biomass stability, we decomposed
the community CV in synchrony and weighted average species CV
components according to @thibaut_understanding_2013:

$$
CV_{com} = \overline{CV_{sp}} \times \sqrt{\phi}
$$

with $CV_{com}$ being the Coefficient of Variation of the community,
$\overline{CV_{sp}}$ the average coefficient of variation of population
pondered by biomass. $\phi$ is the synchrony, which is the ratio the total
community variance ($\sigma^2_{x_T}$) and the sum of population variance
($\sigma_{x_i}$) [@loreau_species_2008]:

$$
\phi = \frac{\sigma^2_{x_T}}{\sum_i{\sigma_{x_i}}}
$$

Species richness was computed as the total species richness over time in a given
station. To normalize by sampling effort, we reported total species richness to
the sum of surface sampled over the time period, it was expressed in number of
species by square meter.

## Network building

```{r}
myload(metaweb_analysis, dir= mypath("data"))
meta <- metaweb_analysis
#metaweb_analysis$resource
#meta$metaweb[meta$resource, meta$resource]
```


---
#- Diet data: 
  #- 7? species over 57 had a piscivorous stage
  #- 3? species had a strict piscivorous stage
  #- ontogenic diet shift based on size
#- 7 Resource nodes:
  #- based on diet database
  #- no information about their biomass
#- Size class:
  #- quantile: 9 size class per species
---

---
#- Interaction:
  #- Fish-resources and resources: based on diet data 
  #- Fish-fish:
    #1. diet data: is piscivorous?
    #2. allometric relationship: predation range from .03 to .45 of body size
---

Network inference was performed in two steps: determine trophic species,  build
a metaweb, subtract the metaweb according to the trophic species present in
community. Diet information were obtained from database and literature. Over
the 57 fish species, only seven had a piscivorous life stage and only three had
as strict piscivorous life stage. Fish species were largely omnivorous. Because
species have ontogenic diet shift, we created nine size classes by species, one
size class of one species constituting one trophic species. The bounds between
size classes were equidistant (percentile method). The metaweb described the
potential trophic interactions between the $`r 57*9`$ ($57\times9$) trophic species. 
We had seven resource nodes which were present in the diet of the trophic
species namely detritus, biofilm, phytoplankton, zooplankton, macrophages,
phytobenthos and zoobenthos. A trophic species belonged to a life stage if the
median of its size range fell in the range of the life stage. In turn, this
trophic species has feeding interactions with the resource nodes of its life stage.
Interactions between resource nodes are determined by literature. For example,
phytobenthos fed on detritus, while zooplankton fed on zooplankton and
phytoplankton. Fish-fish trophic interactions were determined by allometric
relationships as in many studies
[@brose_predator_2019, @poisot_structure_2016, @schneider_body_2012].
For a given trophic species, we first determined if its
size class end up in a life stage containing piscivorous diet. If it did, we
determined the prey size range of the trophic species from 3% to 45% of the
median of its size range. A feeding interaction was set for each trophic species
whose median of its size class fell into the prey range of the predator trophic
species. To sum up, the metaweb was obtained with allometric feeding
interactions (1) between trophic species, (2) between trophic species and
resource nodes and (3) between resource nodes.

The local networks (i.e. one network for each fish community sampling) was
obtained by determining the trophic species of each fish individual in the
community and interactions were set according to the metaweb. All the resource
nodes were assumed to be present in each local network. Finally, the
structure of the local networks varied according the presence of the trophic
species. The inferred interactions represent potential interactions (i.e.
not measured interactions) and are binary (i.e. presence or absence of feeding
interactions).

We computed the connectance ($C = L/N^2$, L and N being resp. the number of
links and of nodes) and the average trophic level of each network, the average
trophic level was weighted the biomass of each node (excluding resource nodes
for which we had no biomass) ($\overline{T} = \sum_i^N{B_iT_i \times
\sum_i^N{B_i}^{-1}}$, $T_i$ and $B_i$ being resp. the trophic level and the
biomass of the node $i$). In order to have connectance at the species level
(i.e. not a trophic species level), we merge the trophic species of the network
by species and thereby aggregating the link by species.

## Habitat and environment

---
#- Collected during fishing operation:
  #- River size (width and depth)
  #- Altitude and slope
  #- distance to source
#- Independant dataset from naiades: 
  #- flow, temperature, DBO
    #1. moving window average
    #2. annual average 
    #3. interpolation along rivers (OpenStars + SSN package)
---

Habitat description were obtained from fish sampling data. We kept variables
describing the ecosystem size namely the stream width and depth, the ecosystem
position (altitude and slope). Physico-chemical variables were obtained from
naiades (http://www.naiades.eaufrance.fr/)[http://www.naiades.eaufrance.fr/].
We chose flow and temperature as physical variables to describe streams as flow
impose swimming constraints which filter fish species that can establish [REF].
Water temperature is linked to physiological constraints namely thermal
tolerance and oxygen concentration tolerance [REF] since the level of water
saturation in oxygen is inversely linked to water temperature. We chose
Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) for a proxy of enrichment in the ecosystem [REF
mccann]. BOD is also inversely linked to oxygen concentration in water.
The time resolution was heterogeneous according to the variable considered
(hourly, daily and monthly for temperature, flow and BOD). For each recording
station, we applied a moving window averaging (more details in supplementary
material) to get rid of seasonal effects and took the annual mean (i.e. one
value by year and by station. As the environmental recording stations were not
located at the same place than the fish stations, we interpolated data with
spatial statistical network model [@isaak_applications_2014] implemented in the 
`SSN` R package [@hoef_ssn:_2014]. The interpolation procedure is detailed
in supplementary material. For each fish station, environmental variables were
matched with the year of fish sampling (except for water temperature for which the 
record began in 2006). Then, the average temperature, flow, BDO, river width
and depth were computed as well as coefficient of variation ($CV = \sigma
\mu^{-1}$). As habitat and environmental variables are often colinear,
a principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the scaled variables. The
PCA explained % of the variance. An axis rotation was performed to maximize the
representation of the variables by the principal components
(Fig. \@ref{fig:pca-rotated}). We kept five axis, representing respectively the
(1) river size (river width & depth), (2) the altitude, slope and decreasing
average temperature, (3) average enrichment (BDO) and CV of flow, (4) river
size CV (CV of river width and depth) and (5) CV of enrichment (CV of BDO).
Additionally, we logged the axis one, two and three to normalize their
distribution and we reversed the third axis to get increasing average
temperature with increasing values of the axis.

###¬†SEM

We computed Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to unravel mechanisms underlying link
between environment, community structure and both biomass stability and total
biomass. Why SEM?

SEM enables to reason in terms of causal relationship between components. We
aimed to understand the mechanisms behind the negative relationship biomass
stability and species richness and the positive relationship between total
biomass and species richness.

We built a metamodel to set up the nodes and the links between the different
compartment of the SEM. Basically, we tested the links between environmental
conditions, community structure and stability. Theory in ecology predicts that
community structure influences stability. In turn, environment influences
community structure but also directly stability.

#### Variables

To characterize environment, we retained five axis of PCA on habitat and
climatic variables which represent different types of forcing (constant and
variability). The two first axis (RC1 and RC2) were linked to the physical
structure and position of the river and the altitutinal gradient (+temperature).
The third axis (RC3) was linked to enrichment (Organic Biological Demand) and CV
of annual flow. The fourth and fifth (RC4 and RC5) axis were associated to
environmental variability, respectively to CV of width and depth of the river
and CV of enrichment.

The community structure was characterized by total species richness,
median average weighted trophic level and median connectance.
Total species richness was the number of unique fish species that were observed
at a given station over the whole sampling. Both median
connectance and average trophic level were just computed as the median over the
temporal period. For the details of the computation of the trophic networks,
see Network inference part.



#### Causal relationships

---
# Environment to community attributes and stability  
---
We linked environmental variables both to community structure and stability
components. Rooted in assembly theory, environment filters species that can
establish in a community and thus affect community structure. (+ add specific
hypothesis about physical and climate). (1) We hypothesized that enrichment
(characterized by DBO) and mean annual temperature will increase species turnover
[@friedpetersen_drivers_2020]. (2) We hypothesized environmental forcing can also
decrease biomass stability directly without going by community structure. First,
instability of habitat and environmental factors may in turn drive biomass
instability [@hansen_climate_2013]. Secondly, average environmental conditions
such as enrichment can increase directly CV by increasing species biomass
fluctuations [@tabi_warming_2019]. Increasing temperature was also hypothesized
to decrease stability through starvation resulting from high metabolic activity
[@tabi_warming_2019].

---
# Species richness to community attributes 
---
To reveal the mechanisms behind the relationship between species richness and
biomass stability, causal links were set from species richness to other
community attributes. (5) We hypothesized also that species richness
decreased connectance following results from @thebault_stability_2010;
@winemiller_must_1989. But theoretically, some ecological networks can show the
inverse relationship [@winemiller_must_1989]. (6) We hypothesized also that species richness
will modulate average weighted trophic level because of food web assembly
processes. If *species richness increased and that new species are placed at
random in the network, we expected a positive relationship between average
trophic level and species richness because individuals of the higher trophic
level have a higher body mass [to think again]*. Finally, we set up causal
relationships from community attributes to stability components. 

---
#  Community attributes to stability
---
We hypothesized that (7) species richness decreased synchrony between species
[REF] and increased $\overline{CV_{sp}}$ [@tilman_biodiversity_2006] *to
complete*. (8a) We expected that average trophic level had a positive or
negative relationship with synchrony, bottom-up effects should result in
positive whereas top-down in negative relationship. We expected a (8b) negative
relationship between average trophic level and $\overline{CV_{sp}}$ if predators
stabilised population
fluctuations or if the increasing part of biomass in the predators decreased
$\overline{CV_{sp}}$ because of their higher body mass (if mean increase faster than
variance). (9a) Connectance was expected to decrease or increase $\overline{CV_{sp}}$
and (9b) synchrony because of top down effects or bottom up effects.

# Total biomass

The average trophic level was the only direct driver of
total biomass ($r_\delta = `r tlvl_on_bm`$) whereas
connectance and species richness had no significant effects (Fig.
\@ref(fig:sem-plot) C). Environmental variables  no direct effects on total
biomass.

Species richness had a indirect positive effect on total biomass through
average trophic level ($`r 0.38*.51`$). The stream size had a total effect on total biomass as strong
as species richness ($r_\delta =`r env_on_bm["log_RC1"]`$), indirectly through average trophic level
and species richness. The avg temperature of the river had an indirect positive
effect on total biomass ($r_\delta = `r env_on_bm["log_RC2"]`$), through
average trophic level and species richness as well. Avg DBO, CV DBO and CV of
river size had no or weak indirect effect on total biomass
(resp. $r_\delta =`r env_on_bm["log_RC3"]`$, $r_\delta =`r env_on_bm["RC5"]`$, $r_\delta =`r env_on_bm["RC4"]`$).

# Biomass stability
---

$\overline{CV_{sp}}$ ($r_\delta = `r cv_sp_on_stab`$) decreased biomass stability more than
synchrony ($r_\delta = `r sync_on_stab`$, Figure \@ref(fig:sem-plot)). Species richness had a strong
positive effect on $\overline{CV_{sp}}$ and a strong negative effect on synchrony
whereas average trophic level and connectance had no significant effects on either
$\overline{CV_{sp}}$ nor synchrony. The environmental variables had
no significant direct effects on either $\overline{CV_{sp}}$ nor synchrony.

Indirectly through synchrony and $\overline{CV_{sp}}$, species richness had a total negative
effect on biomass stability ($r_\delta = `r rich_on_stab`$). Avg river size and
avg temperature had also a total effect which was negative on biomass stability
(resp. $r_\delta = `r env_on_stab["log_RC1"]`$ and $r_\delta = `r
env_on_stab["log_RC2"]`$), going through richness (resp. $r_\delta = `r
env_on_richness["log_RC1"]`$ and $r_\delta = `r env_on_richness["log_RC2"]`$).

- Main outcome:
  - Biomass but stability increased with richness
  - Higher trophic group was more stable that lower one
    - Opposite relationship stability/richness
  - Stability was mainly driven by species richness

# Total biomass versus species richness
---
Species richness increased total biomass (`r b_co_r`% `r b_ci_r` by 1% species
richness increase). Total biomass was `r b_co_t`% `r b_ci_t` higher in the high
than in the low trophic
group. However, the increase of total biomass with the increase of species
richness was lower in the high than the low trophic group (`r b_co_r_t3`% `r
b_ci_r_t3` and `r b_co_r_t2`% `r b_ci_r_t2` respectively,  by 1% species
richness increase).

---
# Stability versus species richness
---

However, biomass stability decreased with species richness (`r s_co_r`% `r s_ci_r` by 1%
species richness increase). Biomass stability was overall `r s_co_t`% `r s_ci_t` higher for the high
than the low trophic group. But biomass stability decreased by `r s_co_r_t3`% by
1% increase in species richness in the high trophic group and increased by `r s_co_r_t2`% `r s_ci_r_t2`
in the low trophic group.

# Discussion

---
# Chapeau
---

For the first time, we assessed the determinants of total biomass and temporal
biomass stability in empirical trophic communities at such high temporal and
spatial scales. We showed that species richness increased total biomass but 
decreased biomass stability. In particular, species richness decreased
synchrony and increased species CV (\LaTeX). Surprisingly, the avg trophic
level and connectance had no effects on either synchrony nor species CV.
Finally, we showed that high trophic group was more stable than low trophic
group but that high trophic group was responsible for the negative
stability-diversity relationship.

---
# Negative relationship between stability and richness 
---

Surprisingly, we found a negative relationship biomass stability and species
richness whereas there was a positive one between total biomass and species
richness. Those relationships followed a power law, meaning that they represent
respectively accelerating and decelerating functions. Overall, it contrasts
with studies in grasslands [@tilman_biodiversity_2006, @zhang_scale_nodate],
mesocosms [@pennekamp_biodiversity_2018] or other animals
[@olivier_independent_nodate] where positive relationships are typically found
between biomass stability (computed as CV) and species richness. In streams as
well, @franssen_annual_2011 found that species richness increased biomass
stability. However other studies found a opposite relationship
[@yang_effects_2011] or a marginal one [@declerc_species_2006].


---
# Total biomass
---

We found that species richness increased total biomass as found in salt
marshes, forests [@wu_relationship_2014,@shuaifeng_positive_2018]. But opposite
relation has been found in richness in grasslands [@grace_integrative_2016],
notably because of light competition. Precedent researches in plant communities
showed that the total biomass was primary driven by environmental drivers. In
contrast, we found that the average trophic level was one of the main driver of the
total biomass, together with the stream size and increasing avg temperature
(with decreasing altitude). The effect of species richness is 
goes through its effect on food web assembly and so, avg trophic level.
The indirect positive effect of species richness on total biomass might be due to
resource use complementarity [@cardinale_species_2002].
It was however unexpected that connectance had no effect on total biomass,
because we could imagine that connectance could also improve resource use, but
this might be true only under the assumption that all species have the same
assimilation efficiency.
We found that the effect of stream size, altitude of the river and its avg
temperature on total biomass was only indirect through community structure

# Effect of environment on community structure
---

The total effect of river size on biomass stability was negative as avg
temperature (and low altitude), indicating that big rivers in plains had a high
negative effect on stability (TO MOVE). We found a mix of both expected and
unexpected results on the effects on environment on community structure. First,
we expected that bigger and low altitude streams had higher species richness
because they might receive more
confluents streams and so more species through immigration.
Stream size increased avg trophic level. An increase in mean trophic position
of piscivorous species in bigger rivers could explain this relation
[@post_ecosystem_2000]. In our network reconstruction, the fish-fish
interactions are more resolved than fish-resource interactions.
@petchey_predicting_2010 predicted that temperature should increase connectance
but we did not find any relationship but temperature (and
low altitude) increased avg trophic level (**Bullshit**). 
CV of enrichment decreased both connectance and avg trophic level, while avg
enrichment (and CV of flow) increased avg trophic level. The latter might by explained by
the fact that enrichment can benefit to top trophic level
[@hulot_functional_2000]. One explanation for the former is that enrichment
variation might destabilize top predators (REF or Bullshit again).

# Effect of synchrony and cv_sp  
---


Species richness decreased synchrony and increased $\overline{CV_{sp}}$. Species
richness can reduce synchrony through decrease of population size, thus raising
the role of demographic stochasticity [@loreau_species_2008] but also in the
case where species have different responses to environmental variation
[@loreau_species_2008]. While the effect of species richness on synchrony is
well understood, its effect on $\overline{CV_{sp}}$ is more complex. 

In turn, we found that synchrony and $\overline{CV_{sp}}$ both decreased biomass
stability, as predicted by the formulation of stability based on the CV
[@thibaut_understanding_2013]. However, it was unexpected that the average
population $\overline{CV_{sp}}$ had a stronger negative effect on biomass
stability than synchrony [@bluthgen_land_2016; @olivier_independent_nodate]. We
can advance two hypothesis that can raise this effect. First, the opportunity
for diet differentiation can be low in streams compare to other organisms. Bird
species are for example quite specialized in seed size, flying or soil arthropods or
mammals which gives opportunities for independent dynamics. Plants also can
achieve independent dynamics either spatial segregation or niche
differentiation. Because fish species even piscivorous one are quite
opportunistic in their foraging.
Secondly, in trophic communities, species directly affect each other through
feeding interactions, and so could raise synchrony between species
[@raimondo_interspecific_2004] more than in systems where interactions happen
more in the form of competitive exploitation.

# Effect of trophic level and connectance are richness effects:
---

Our path analysis revealed that, although species richness has a strong effect on
connectance and the average trophic level, network structure  itself had little
to no effect either on synchrony nor average population stability. This result
contradicts precedent theoretical studies on the relationship
between stability and network structure [@angelis_stability_1975,
@may_will_1972], although they considered different stability metrics (i.e.
local stability of equilibrium point). The reason might be that in our inferred
network, network structure is strongly constraints by assembly processes.
Indeed, connectance generally decreased with increasing species richness
[@winemiller_must_1989, @thebault_stability_2010], because a small fraction of
links are realized because of food diet constraints. In theoretical studies,
connectance can be tuned from 0 (no links) to 1 (all possible links are
present) [@angelis_stability_1975]. The link between the average trophic level
and species richness has been less studied. However, we can suppose that
because species richness increase total biomass, species richness also increase
both the biomass of prey available for piscivorous fishes and the biomass of
piscivorous species which in turn, increase the avg trophic level of the
community. In sum, the biomass stability of freshwater ecosystems can be
derived by species richness because, through trophic structure constraints,
species richness determine largely network structure.


---
# Trophic group
---

The total biomass of high and low trophic group trophic groups responded both
positively to species richness but not biomass stability. There is a
paradox where the high trophic group is overall more stable than the low but
species richness had a destabilizing effect on the former whereas a stabilizing
on the latter. @shanafelt_david_w._stability_nodate showed in a theoretical
study in trophic chains, the top trophic level is the more stable TOEXPLORE.
The comparison between our study and theoretical studies stays limited because
fishes in our system have a large diet and consume food item of several trophic
level while theoretical studies consider system in which one species of one
trophic level feeds only on the trophic level directly inferior
