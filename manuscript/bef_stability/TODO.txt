# First category

- [ ] Add network description

# Second category

## Intro

- [ ] Detail total biomass and stability mecanisms 

## Methods

- [ ] Org methods by question

- [x] Make a method slide
  - [x] Map
  - [/] Network inference
  - [x] Metaweb 
  - [x] Hypothesis slide
  - [x] Temporal network
- [ ] See [@arnoldi_] 2019 for the links between species abundances and CV

- [ ] Mid point used in niche model to characterize feeding links [@dunne__2006] 

- [ ] Explain SEM
  - [ ] Choice of variables
  - [ ] Choice of SEM type, according to Grace

## Results

- [ ] PCA
  - [x] scatter plot
  - [x] contribution table
  - [ ] Nicer plot
  - [ ] Plot temperature altitude
  - [x] Covaration variables

- [ ] Make idw temperature and flow

## Discussion

- [ ] hypothesis-evt: CV (mainly sync and CVsp) versus mean (mainly biomass and
  community str)

## Appendix

- [x] Make Rsq tables
- [x] Estimate basin effects
- [ ] Comment basin effects 
- [x] Show sensibility SEM with different datasets
- [ ] Comment sensibility analysis 
- [ ] Add latex metamodel with references

## All

- [x] First biomass then stability
- [x] Separate hypothesis: confirmation and new evidence

- 

# Third category

- [ ] Write abstract
