# The story summary

1. What is the central question?

What are the drivers of community stability and total biomass in trophic communities? 

2. Why is this question important?

Drivers are known horizontal diversity but not for vertical diversity

3. What data are needed to answer this question?

3.a Temporal description of species biomass: CV and synchrony 
3.b Description of the network structure
3.c Description of the habitat and the environment

4. What methods are used to get those data?

4.a Temporal description of species biomass
4.a.1 Long term monitoring of fish communities 
4.a.2 Reconstruction of fish communities according to protocol 
4.a.3 Biomass according to length
4.a.4 Standardize biomass and richness by sampling effort
4.a.5 Keep stations followed more than ten years
4.a.6 Keep station stable in time

4.b Compute stability, synchrony and cv_sp

4.c Get the network 
4.c.1 Build a metaweb according to trait matching: ontogenic diet and body size
4.c.2 get the local metaweb according to the metaweb
4.c.3 Compute connectance and average trophic level

4.d Get habitat
4.d.1 River habitat: width and depth, slope and altitude in fish sampling
description
4.d.2 Flow, DBO and temperature: naiades data; annual mean then interpolation
4.d.3 CV and average over time
4.d.3 PCA to reduce de dimensionality

5. What analysis must be applied for the data to answer the central question? 

5.a SEM linking env to com and env to stab/bm, rich to com and to stab/bm, com
to stab/bm

6. What data were obtained?

7. What were the results of the analysis?

7.a  CVsp had an effect twice higher on biomass stability than synchrony
7.b  horizontal diversity had the stronger negative effects
7.c  vertical and horizontal diversity had an independant effect on stability
7.d  Total effect of environment 

8. How did the analysis answer the central question?



9. What does this answer tell us about the broader field?
