The goal of this document is to describe the work that has been done previously
by Edeline et al. (2013) and Bonnaf√©, Le Gendre and Edeline (in prep.).

## Data information

Those informations were extracted from the two studies previously cited  

- 4,145,234 individual body size measurements of fish
- 50 species
- 20,809 fisheries operation in 7,024 stations 
- 8 french basins (North, Seine River, Channel Sea, Atlantic Ocean, Loire
River, Garonne River, Rhone River, Mediterranean Sea)
- Catching by electric fishing 
  - 3 different strategies:
    - Boat
    - Walking
    - Mixed
  - 5 different methods:
    - Complete: whole station surface fully sampled
    - Ambiance: whole station surface partially sampled
    - Points: Point Abundance Sampling method (Nelva et al., 1979)
    - Bank: only river banks were sampled
    - Other: other partial sampling strategies depending on river width and
      depth
- Measurements:
  - Count
  - Body length (only on a fraction of the fish if they were too numerous)
- Exclusion: migratory species with a saltwater growth period
- Environmental data:
  - river slope
  - depth
  - channel width (at upper banks)
  - altitude
  - distance to the sea
  - distance to the source
  - anthropogenic usage of the watershed (Corine Land
Cover data)
  - air temperature that preceded each sampling operation as a proxy for
    river water temperature.
