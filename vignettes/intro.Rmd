# Post-doc objectives

According to the postdoc advertisement:

1. Characterize the temporal stability of the studied communities
2. Disentangle the drivers of stability and to understand how trophic and
   community structures influence stability

# Temporal stability and diversity 

## The big questions

- What are the effects of global changes on community stability? 
  - What are the underlying mechanisms of the response of community stability to
    global changes?
  - Which facets of stability are affected by global changes?

- Are species role constant in time ? (e.g. keystone ?)


## Reading notes 

- A lot of studies assume that the community stability facing global changes is
  driven by richness and its effects on population asynchrony, but other suggest
  that there are **independant effects of forcing** and **richness** on community
  stability [@olivier_independent_nodate]. 
    - @olivier_independent_nodate suggest that effect of global changes on
      abundance can drive community stability (without effect on species
      richness)
    - Asynchrony is due to difference in response to forcing variables and/or
      changement of competitive hierarchy?
- Most research on the subject (link forcing, stability and species richness) has been done in controlled experiment (plant,
  mesocosm?)
    - Few test in local natural population
    - Cedar Creek's experiments [@tilman_biodiversity_2014]
- Ecology of perturbation is missing: notably its effects on abundance ?
  [@olivier_independent_nodate]

- **Facets of stability** [@donohue_navigating_2016]:
  - **Variability**: temporal or spatial Variability
    - Measurement: CV
  - **Resistance**: community structure change induced by a perturbation
    - Measurement: ratio of the variable value before and after perturbation
  - **Persistance**: time length, the community stays in the same state
    - Measurement: time until a change appear after invasion of a species or a
      loss a species 
  - **Tipping point**: permanent change of system state
    - Measurement: bimodality for same environmental variable [@berdugo_plant_2017;@blonder_predictability_2017]
  - **Resilience**: multi-dimensional notion. Capacity of the system to keep the
    same relationship between population and state variables
    - Measurement:

## Fish Data information

The goal of this part is to describe the work that has been done previously
by @edeline_ecological_2013 and @bonnafe_trophic_nodate.

Those informations were extracted from the two studies previously cited  

- 4,145,234 individual body size measurements of fish
- 50 species
- 20,809 fisheries operation in 7,024 stations 
- 8 french basins (North, Seine River, Channel Sea, Atlantic Ocean, Loire
River, Garonne River, Rhone River, Mediterranean Sea)
- Catching by electric fishing 
  - 3 different strategies:
    - Boat
    - Walking
    - Mixed
  - 5 different methods:
    - Complete: whole station surface fully sampled
    - Ambiance: whole station surface partially sampled
    - Points: Point Abundance Sampling method (Nelva et al., 1979)
    - Bank: only river banks were sampled
    - Other: other partial sampling strategies depending on river width and
      depth
- Measurements:
  - Count
  - Body length (only on a fraction of the fish if they were too numerous)
- Exclusion: migratory species with a saltwater growth period
- Environmental data:
  - river slope
  - depth
  - channel width (at upper banks)
  - altitude
  - distance to the sea
  - distance to the source
  - anthropogenic usage of the watershed (Corine Land
Cover data)
  - air temperature that preceded each sampling operation as a proxy for
    river water temperature.

### Network construction [@bonnafe_trophic_nodate]

From literature, @bonnafe_trophic_nodate had rebuilding the global trophic
network (also called the "metaweb"). From the local cooccurence data, they built
the local trophic network.

- Node types:
  - Fish 
  - Resources
- Three types of interaction:
  - Fish-Fish  
  - Fish-Resources  
  - Resources-Resources  

#### Metaweb

The metaweb is a virtual web containing all the nodes of the dataset and links
between them as if they would cooccur all together.

- Components:
  1. A set of Nodes (N): Fish (F) and Resources (R)
  2. An interaction matrix (L)

- Two different metawebs:
  1. Fish nodes defined as 9 size class by species ($9\times50=450$)
  2. Fish nodes defined as 1 by species $50$)

Comparing the two metawebs permit to disentangle network answer in terms of
population size structure (2) from species composition (1).


##### Defining nodes

@bonnafe_trophic_nodate have looked for fish diet and ontogenic food diet in
literature. 

- Seven Resource nodes:
  - Detritus (R1)
  - Biofilm (R2)
  - Phytobenthos (R3)
  - Macrophyte (R4)
  - Phytoplankton (R5)
  - Zooplankton (R6)
  - Zoobenthos (R7)

- Fish nodes (metaweb 1), for each species (i = 1,2,3, ..., 9):
  - 9 size classes (j = 1,2,3, ..., 9)
  - Size classes attributed by size quantile distribution 
  - Total: $F_{ij} = {F11,...}$
- Fish nodes (metaweb 2), for each species (i = 1,2,3, ..., 9):
  - $F_{ij} = {F11, F21, F31, ...}$ (j is constant)

##### Defining links

Based on literature [@bonnafe_trophic_nodate].

- Resource - Resource:
  - Biofilm and Detritus do not feed on other nodes
  - phytoplankton, phytobenthos, and macrophytes -> detritus
  - zooplankton -> phytoplankton and itself 
  - Zoobenthos -> all Resource nodes (including itself)

- Resource - Fish:
  - Diet of each species and ontogenic shifts known by literature
  - Size of diet shift known for 22/50 species
    - Infered for the other species according stomach content records in literature

- Fish - Fish, for each species:
  1. occurrence of piscivory 
  2. ontogenic shift to piscivory
  3. derivation of a predation window

- The predation window model:
  - Predator and prey body size: $B_P$ and $B_N$
  - $\alpha \leqslant \frac{B_N}{B_P} \leqslant \beta$
  - $\alpha$ and $\beta$ define respectively the lower and upper range of the
    predation window
  1. The midpoint of the predator size class ($B_{P_{j,mid}}$) is projected on the predation
     window. 
     - It gives the $B_{N,min; P_{j,mid}}$ and $B_{N,max; P_{j,mid}}$ for the predator midclass 
     - $B_{N,min; P_{j,mid}} = \alpha B_{P_{j,mid}}$  **Not sure** 
     - $B_{N,max; P_{j,mid}} = \beta B_{P_{j,mid}}$  **Not sure**
  2. A trophic link between the predator ($B_{P_{j}}$) and the prey size class
     ($B_{N_{j}}$) is drawn if $B_{N,min; P_{j,mid}} \leqslant B_{N_{j,mid}}
     \leqslant B_{N,max; P_{j,mid}}$. 
     - IOW, if the mid of the prey size class fall in the predator window
